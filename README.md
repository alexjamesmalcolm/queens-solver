# Queens Solver

This is a solver for the LinkedIn game [Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens/). My goal is to use this as an example of a "no goal" PuLP program.

## Adjacency Constraints

With a 2x2 grid there are:

- 2 Vertical constraints
- 2 Horizontal constraints
- 2 Diagonal constraints

With a 3x3 grid there are:

- 6 Vertical constraints
- 6 Horizontal constraints
- 8 Diagonal constraints

With a 4x4 grid there are:

- 12 Vertical constraints
- 12 Horizontal constraints
- 18 Diagonal constraints
